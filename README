This is Johann Burkard's StringSearch library.   I couldn't find a public repo, so I simply created one.

Thanks for sharing your work Mr. Burkard.

More info http://johannburkard.de/software/stringsearch
and in the API documentation

From his website:
StringSearch

High-perfor­mance pattern matching algo­rithms in Java

The Java language lacks fast string searching algorithms. StringSearch provides implementations of the Boyer-Moore and the Shift-Or (bit-parallel) algorithms. These algorithms are easily five to ten times faster than the naïve implementation found in java.lang.String. [repo creators note: Java doesn't use naïve string search]
